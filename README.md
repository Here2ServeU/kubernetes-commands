# Mastering Kubernetes: kubectl Commands, YAML Templates & GitOps Workflows

This guide includes over 50 essential `kubectl` commands grouped by category, realistic outputs, and reusable YAML templates for Helm, GitOps, CI/CD, and Kustomize workflows.

## Introduction

This cheat sheet is your comprehensive reference for working with Kubernetes, specifically designed for DevOps engineers, site reliability engineers (SREs), cloud architects, and platform engineers who interact with Kubernetes clusters daily.

It is structured into two parts:

Part 1 focuses on the foundational and essential `kubectl` commands used for operating Kubernetes resources. These commands are grouped by categories such as Cluster Management, Pod Management, Deployment Management, and more. Each command is paired with a concise explanation and expected output, helping you understand not only what to run-but also what to expect when you do.

These commands cover core concepts like:
- Nodes and clusters: Understanding the health and configuration of your Kubernetes cluster.
- Namespaces: Isolating workloads for dev, stage, and prod environments.
- Pods: The smallest deployable units in Kubernetes that encapsulate containerized applications.
- Deployments: Managing stateless apps with rolling updates and replica sets.
- Services and Ingress: Exposing workloads within or outside the cluster.

Part 2 delves into advanced topics with reusable YAML templates for Helm, GitOps, CI/CD, and Kustomize.

Here's how these concepts help in modern infrastructure workflows:
- Helm simplifies packaging and deploying applications using reusable charts, useful for maintaining versioned microservices.
- GitOps (via FluxCD or ArgoCD) treats Git as the source of truth, enabling automated synchronization between code and cluster state.
- Kustomize provides environment-specific configuration management without duplicating YAML files, helping manage overlays like dev, stage, and prod.
- CI/CD pipelines using tools like GitHub Actions automate deployments to Kubernetes right after code is pushed to your repository, reducing manual ops and human error.

Each template is written for real-world use and ready for you to customize, apply, and scale. The goal of this guide is to eliminate trial-and-error and provide a solid operational and deployment baseline.
